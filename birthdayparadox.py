print('''Birthday Paradox, by Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com

The birthday paradox shows us that in a group of N people, the odds
that two of them have matching birthdays is surprixingly large.
This program does a Monte Carlo simulation (that is, repeated random 
simulations) to explore this concept.

(It's not actually a paradox, it's just a surprising result.)
